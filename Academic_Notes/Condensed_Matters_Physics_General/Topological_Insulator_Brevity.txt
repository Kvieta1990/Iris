Topological insulator -> insulator inside but conductive on the surface -> Quantum Hall effect -> 
Funny way of electron moving in the body (as circles) and on the surface (semicircles) to make the
body insulating and surface conductive -> validate the time reversal symmetry -> thus we have to 
take into account of the electron spins -> spin can be changed simutaneously either clockwise or
counterclockwise in the quantum world -> thus inpurity cannot break the lining-up of the surface 
spins -> free traveling electrons.

PS: Electron spin -> complex vector space (see YouTube tutorial) -> spinor (see wikipedia) -> rotate 
720 to return to where it was originally.
